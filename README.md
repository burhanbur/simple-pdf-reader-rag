# Simple PDF Reader with RAG

A streamlined PDF reader application that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using DeepSeek R1 and Ollama. This application allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content, receiving accurate, context-aware responses.

## Features

- üìÑ PDF document upload and processing
- üîç Semantic chunking for better context understanding
- üß† RAG implementation using DeepSeek R1 model via Ollama
- üí° Interactive Q&A interface
- üé® Clean and intuitive user interface with Streamlit

## Technologies Used

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Web interface
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) - RAG implementation
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) - Local LLM integration
- [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) - Vector storage
- [PDFPlumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) - PDF processing
- HuggingFace Embeddings - Text embeddings

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ollama installed with DeepSeek R1 model

## Installation
